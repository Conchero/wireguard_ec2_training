EC2 VPN Training 

Largely inspired by [https://github.com/LINALIN1979/wireguard-on-ec2] works, Thank you !

I didn't wanted to just fork his/her repository for training purpose so after analysing each .sh files

I decided to recreate his/her install.sh line by line to assimilate each cli

Right now working on client CRUD and connexion management*

Come back for more updates :)
